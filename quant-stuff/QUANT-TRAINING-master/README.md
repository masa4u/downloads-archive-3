# QUANT-TRAINING
Quantitative Finance Training

The goal is to create a repository of code for those who, like me, are leaning quantitative finance
and writing python.

Since I'm new to python, there will be opportunities to imporve the code and add to it.

For those learning, hopefully these files will provide some tools.

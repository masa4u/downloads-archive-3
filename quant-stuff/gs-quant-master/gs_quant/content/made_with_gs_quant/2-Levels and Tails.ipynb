    "In this note, I lay down a framework for analyzing swap rates levels both in spot and forward space, and rolldown for G3 currencies. I find that:\n",
    "* In USD swaps, the move over the last 3 months has been an almost parallel rally across the curve in spot space. But when we look at it in forward space, we find some nuances: \n",
    "    * 1y2y and 1y3y rallied the most as the market started pricing a deeper cutting cycle in the next 2 years\n",
    "    * 9y1y and 30y1y rallied more than points around them as investors use those liquid points for long duration hedges  \n",
    "*\tThe curve is now overall very flat, though the belly of the curve has slowly steepened over the last 6 months\n",
    "*\tFor investors looking to go long rates, the current shape of the curve would favor going long the backend in forward space (e.g. 5y5y) as thatâ€™s where there is a slightly favorable rolldown\n",
    "*\tOn a comparative basis:\n",
    "\t* the EUR curve is lower and steeper (as front end rates are at the lower bound) making it slightly more attractive from a roll-down perspective (but with less room to rally); and\n",
    "    * the GBP curve lower but flatter making it a slightly more attractive hedge for a broad duration sell-off\n",

    "OTC Derivatives Risk Disclosures: \n",
    "Terms of the Transaction: To understand clearly the terms and conditions of any OTC derivative transaction you may enter into, you should carefully review the Master Agreement, including any related schedules, credit support documents, addenda and exhibits. You should not enter into OTC derivative transactions unless you understand the terms of the transaction you are entering into as well as the nature and extent of your risk exposure. You should also be satisfied that the OTC derivative transaction is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial condition. You may be requested to post margin or collateral to support written OTC derivatives at levels consistent with the internal policies of Goldman Sachs. \n",
    " \n",
    "Liquidity Risk: There is no public market for OTC derivative transactions and, therefore, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate an existing position on favorable terms. Transfer Restrictions: OTC derivative transactions entered into with one or more affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman Sachs) cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without its prior written consent and, therefore, it may be impossible for you to transfer any OTC derivative transaction to a third party. \n",
    " \n",
    "Conflict of Interests: Goldman Sachs may from time to time be an active participant on both sides of the market for the underlying securities, commodities, futures, options or any other derivative or instrument identical or related to those mentioned herein (together, \"the Product\"). Goldman Sachs at any time may have long or short positions in, or buy and sell Products (on a principal basis or otherwise) identical or related to those mentioned herein. Goldman Sachs hedging and trading activities may affect the value of the Products. \n",
    " \n",
    "Counterparty Credit Risk: Because Goldman Sachs, may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you must evaluate the credit risk of doing business with Goldman Sachs or its affiliates. \n",
    " \n",
    "Pricing and Valuation: The price of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between Goldman Sachs and each counterparty and Goldman Sachs does not represent or warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available, possibly making it difficult for you to establish what is a fair price for a particular OTC derivative transaction; The value or quoted price of the Product at any time, however, will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted. If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the offered Product, the price quoted by Goldman Sachs would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, and the quoted price (and the value of the Product that Goldman Sachs will use for account statements or otherwise) could be higher or lower than the original price, and may be higher or lower than the value of the Product as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs. If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase the Product or otherwise values the Product, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, if you sell the Product, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. Goldman Sachs may conduct market making activities in the Product. To the extent Goldman Sachs makes a market, any price quoted for the OTC derivative transactions, Goldman Sachs may differ significantly from (i) their value determined by reference to Goldman Sachs pricing models and (ii) any price quoted by a third party. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs. \n",
    " \n",
    "Market Making, Investing and Lending: Goldman Sachs engages in market making, investing and lending businesses for its own account and the accounts of its affiliates in the same or similar instruments underlying OTC derivative transactions (including such trading as Goldman Sachs deems appropriate in its sole discretion to hedge its market risk in any OTC derivative transaction whether between Goldman Sachs and you or with third parties) and such trading may affect the value of an OTC derivative transaction. \n",
    " \n",
    "Early Termination Payments: The provisions of an OTC Derivative Transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or Goldman Sachs may be required to make a potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC Derivative Transaction is in-the-money to Goldman Sachs or you at the time of termination. Indexes: Goldman Sachs does not warrant, and takes no responsibility for, the structure, method of computation or publication of any currency exchange rates, interest rates, indexes of such rates, or credit, equity or other indexes, unless Goldman Sachs specifically advises you otherwise.\n",
    "Risk Disclosure Regarding futures, options, equity swaps, and other derivatives as well as non-investment-grade securities and ADRs: Please ensure that you have read and understood the current options, futures and security futures disclosure document before entering into any such transactions. Current United States listed options, futures and security futures disclosure documents are available from our sales representatives or at http://www.theocc.com/components/docs/riskstoc.pdf,  http://www.goldmansachs.com/disclosures/risk-disclosure-for-futures.pdf and https://www.nfa.futures.org/investors/investor-resources/files/security-futures-disclosure.pdf, respectively. Certain transactions - including those involving futures, options, equity swaps, and other derivatives as well as non-investment-grade securities - give rise to substantial risk and are not available to nor suitable for all investors. If you have any questions about whether you are eligible to enter into these transactions with Goldman Sachs, please contact your sales representative. Foreign-currency-denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates that could have an adverse effect on the value or price of, or income derived from, the investment. In addition, investors in securities such as ADRs, the values of which are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.\n",
    "Options Risk Disclosures: Options may trade at a value other than that which may be inferred from the current levels of interest rates, dividends (if applicable) and the underlier due to other factors including, but not limited to, expectations of future levels of interest rates, future levels of dividends and the volatility of the underlier at any time prior to maturity. Note: Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Please ensure that you have read and understood the current options disclosure document before entering into any standardized options transactions. United States listed options disclosure documents are available from our sales representatives or at http://theocc.com/publications/risks/riskstoc.pdf. A secondary market may not be available for all options. Transaction costs may be a significant factor in option strategies calling for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads. When purchasing long options an investor may lose their entire investment and when selling uncovered options the risk is potentially unlimited. Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other similar information will be supplied upon request.\n",

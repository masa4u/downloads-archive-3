The LEAN Report Creator (LRC) is a report generated from backtesting-result objects and allows you to quickly create polished, professional-grade reports for each backtest (see a full <a href="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/blog/tutorial-lrc-report-rev1.html">example report</a> generated by LRC). We hope that you can use these reports to share your strategy performance with prospective investors. 
The report was generated using the examples provided in this tutorial.

The algorithm used to generate the example report is provided below.

Users working through the QuantConnect.com IDE can have these reports generated automatically at the end of a backtest. To generate one, look at the “Report” tab below your backtest result charts and click "Request Report".

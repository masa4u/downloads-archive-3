<p>
This chart shows the drawdown of each day. A certain day's drawdown is defined as the percentage of loss compared to the maximum value before this day. The drawdowns are calculated based on daily data. The top 5 drawdown periods are marked in the chart with different colors.

<h4>Monthly Returns</h4>

<p>
This chart shows the return of each month. We convert original price series into monthly series and calculate the returns of each month. The green color indicates positive return, the red color indicates negative return, and the greater the loss is, the darker the color is; the yellow color means the gain or loss is rather small; the white color means the month is not included in the backtest period. The values in the cells are in percentage.
</p>

<h4>Annual Returns</h4>

<p>This chart shows the return of each year. We calculate the total return within each year, shown by the blue bars. The red dotted line represents the average of the annual returns.
</p>

<h4>Crisis Events</h4>

<p>This group of charts shows the behaviors of both your strategy and the benchmark during a certain historical period. We set the value of your strategy the same as the benchmark at the beginning of each crisis event, and the lines represent the cumulative returns of your strategy and benchmark from the beginning of this crisis event. The report only draws the crisis event charts whose periods are covered by your strategy.
</p>

<h4>Asset Allocations</h4>

<p>
The asset allocation charts show a time-weighted average of each asset to your portfolio. When a certain asset has a very small percentage and is too small to be shown in the pie chart, it will be incorporated into an "Others" category. The value of the percentage could be either positive or negative.

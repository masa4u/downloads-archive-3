Creating a fully supported brokerage is a challenging endeavor. LEAN requires a number of individual pieces which together form a complete brokerage implementation. This guide aims to describe in as much detail as possible what you need to do for each module. There are <b>nine</b> key components to implement - these are described individually in the sections below.

Each submitted brokerage pull-request must pass all tests before being merged. Partially completed brokerage implementations are acceptable if merged to a branch. It's easy to fall behind master so be sure to keep your branch updated with the master branch. Please make sure to read LEAN's <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style-and-testing">coding style guidelines</a> and comply with the code commenting and design standards.

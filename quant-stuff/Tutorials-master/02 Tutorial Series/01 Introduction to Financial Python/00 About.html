<p>This tutorial series introduces basic Python applied to financial concepts. If you have great investment ideas but don't know how to write them, or if you think you need to learn some basic skills in quantitative finance, then this is a good starting point. The series is broken into four parts: python, math and statistics, basic financial concepts related to investment and financial time series analysis.</p>

<p>We not only introduce the concepts but also show you how to apply the introduced techniques step by step using Python code snippets. We use real financial datasets as examples and after each chapter we design a QuantConnect algorithm applying what we learned.</p>

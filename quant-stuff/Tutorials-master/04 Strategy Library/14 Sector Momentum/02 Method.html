This algorithm is an adaptation of asset class momentum. Instead of rotating ETFs in different asset classes,
the sector momentum algorithm picks 10 sector ETFs and pick 3 ETFs with the strongest 12-month momentum into
the portfolio and weight them equally. The portfolio is rebalanced at the start of each month.

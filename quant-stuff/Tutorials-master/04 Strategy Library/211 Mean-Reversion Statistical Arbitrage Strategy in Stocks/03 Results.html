<p>
    In our alorithm, the portfolio is rebalanced every 30 days and the backtest period runs from Jan 2010 to Aug 2019. 
    Our result is an annual rate of return over 7% with a max drawdown of around 40% for nearly 10 years. Our performance indicates 
    using PCA combined with linear regression to measure the deviation level is reasonable.

<p>
    To tune the model, we could expand our universe of stocks beyond the current 20 equities or incorporate more PCA components.
    We could also come up with another way to measure the level of deviation or change the rebalance frequency of the algorithm 
    (30 days in this example).

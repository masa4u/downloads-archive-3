  The strategy was backtest at a 60-year timespan. It's persistent, systematic and intuitive. Although our version is very different from the paper one, the logic and intuition behind are the same. It has a better performance than the paper strategy because we added short positions.
  For further development, we can try to rank a large number of stocks, and do some portfolio optimization instead of holding stocks equally.

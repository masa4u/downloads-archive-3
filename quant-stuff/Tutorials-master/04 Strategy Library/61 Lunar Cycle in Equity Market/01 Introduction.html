<p>
  The lunar phase is the shape of the direct sunlight portion of the Moon as viewed from Earth.
  The lunar phases gradually and cyclically change over the period of a month.
  Lunar phases have proven effects on human biology and psychology.
  Investors are subject to various psychological and behavioral biases and mood fluctuations.
  Therefore if lunar phases affect mood, by extension, these phases may affect investor behavior and thus asset prices.
  This tutorial we will build an algorithm based upon the Moon phase.

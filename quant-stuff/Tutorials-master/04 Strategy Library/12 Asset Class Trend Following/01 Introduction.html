  Asset class trend following is a strategy that tries to exploit a momentum anomaly between various assets. It uses various moving averages or momentum filters to gain an exposure to an asset class only at the time when there is a higher probability for outperformance with less risk.
  The basic logic behind the trend following is finding a method to detect the trend of price movement and buy an asset when its price trend goes up, and sell when its trend goes down.

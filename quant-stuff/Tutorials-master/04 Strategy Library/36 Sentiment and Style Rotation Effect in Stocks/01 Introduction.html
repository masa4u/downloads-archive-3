  Growth stocks refer to high-quality, successful companies whose earnings are expected to continue growing at an above-average rate relative to the market.
  Growth stocks generally have high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and high price-to-book(P/B) ratios. At times, growth stocks are considered expensive and overvalued. The value stocks refer to stocks which have high dividend payout ratios or low financial ratios such as P/E ratios and P/B ratios. The value stocks are often considered undervalued by the market. This algorithm will create the long-short positions based on the relation between investor sentiment and the performance of value stocks over growth stocks.

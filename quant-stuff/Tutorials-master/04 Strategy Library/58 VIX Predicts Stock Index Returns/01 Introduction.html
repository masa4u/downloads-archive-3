  VIX index is the weighted average of the implied volatilities computed from a total of eight near-the-money, nearby and second nearby American option contracts on the underlying S&amp;P100 index. The index is calculated on an intraday basis by the CBOE.
  The extreme levels of the VIX index are a strong indicator of equity index returns.
  One could anticipate that the higher the fear in the markets, indicated by the VIX index, the higher the subsequent returns on the broad equity index.
  In this algorithm, we will explore if VIX index is the forward-looking indicator of future stock index returns.

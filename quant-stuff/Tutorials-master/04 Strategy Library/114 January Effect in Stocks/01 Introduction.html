  The January effect is a calendar anomaly saying that small-cap stocks returns in January are especially strong.
  The most common explanation of this phenomenon is that individual investors, who are income tax-sensitive and who disproportionately hold small stocks, sell stocks for tax reasons at year end and reinvest during the first month of the year.
  In this algorithm, we will explore the January effect in the stock market.

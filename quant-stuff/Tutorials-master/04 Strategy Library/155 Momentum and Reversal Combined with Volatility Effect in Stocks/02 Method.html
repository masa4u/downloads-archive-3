<h4>The Universe Initial Filter</h4>
<p>
  The investment universe consists of NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks with prices higher than $5 per share.
  In <code>FineSelectionFunction</code>, we divide the universe into two equal halves by size of the company.
  Here size is defined as the share price times the number of shares outstanding.

<h4>The Realized Return and Volatility</h4>
<p>
  At the beginning of each month, realized returns and realized (annualized) volatilities are calculated for each stock.
  The realized volatility refers to the historical volatility. The formula of the realized volatility \(\sigma\) is
</p>
\[R_{avg}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n R_i}{n}\]
\[\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(R_i-R_{avg})^2}{n-1}}\]
<p>
   To annualize the volatility, we multiply the 1-day volatility by the square root of the number of trading days in a year â€“ in our case square root of 252.
</p>
<p>
  A 6-month warm-up period is required to initialize the history price for stocks in the universe. We create the class
  <code>SymbolData</code> to save all required variables associated with a single stock.
  One week (5 trading days) prior to the beginning of each month is skipped to avoid biases due to microstructures.

<p>
  After the warm-up period, the historical price series is ready. Stocks are sorted into quintiles based on their realized volatility.
  Stocks in the top 20% highest volatility are further sorted into quintiles by their six-month realized returns.
  The algorithm goes long on stocks from the highest performing quintile from the highest volatility group and short on stocks from the lowest performing quintile from the highest volatility group.

<h4>Portfolio Rebalance and Trade</h4>
<p>
  The methodology of Jegadeesh and Titamn (1993) is used to rebalance the portfolio.
  Specifically, at the beginning of each month, stocks are sorted into quintiles based on their realized returns and equally weighted portfolios are formed to be held for the next six months.
  This sorting and portfolio formation procedure is performed each month. In any given month t, the strategy holds 6 portfolios that are selected in the current month as well as the previous 5 months.
  Therefore 1/6 of the portfolio is rebalanced every month. We save those 6 portfolios in a deque list <code>self.portfolios</code> and the list is updated every month. The portfolio of the current month is added while the portfolio selected from six months ago is removed from the list.

    self.portfolios = deque(maxlen=6)
def OnData(self, data):

    # 1/6 of the portfolio is rebalanced every month
    if len(self.portfolios) == self.portfolios.maxlen:
        for i in list(self.portfolios)[0]:
            self.Liquidate(i)
    # stocks are equally weighted and held for 6 months
    short_weight = 1/len(short)
    for i in short:
        self.SetHoldings(i, -1/6*short_weight)

    long_weight = 1/len(long)
    for i in long:
        self.SetHoldings(i, 1/6*long_weight)

  Momentum is a well-known strategy that buys stocks with the best return over the past three to twelve months and sells stocks with the worst performances over the same time horizon.
  The reversal strategy buys the stocks with relatively low returns and sells stocks with high returns. In this algorithm, we will develop a long-short strategy combining the momentum/reversal effect with the realized volatility.

  Equity valuation may be a predictive signal for future equity return. There are various methodologies to evaluate whether
  the equity is undervalued or overvalued using metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E), return on equity (ROE), dividend yield, book-to-equity and so on.
  In this algorithm, we use a ten-year normalized earnings metrics invented by Yale University professor Robert Shiller to find the fair value of the equity market.

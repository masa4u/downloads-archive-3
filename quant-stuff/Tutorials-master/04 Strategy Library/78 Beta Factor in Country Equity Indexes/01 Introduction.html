  Some investors are prohibited from using leverage and other investorsâ€™ leverage is limited by margin requirements.
  Their only way to achieve higher returns is to buy more risky stocks which makes these assets more expensive.
  High-beta and risky assets should therefore deliver lower risk-adjusted returns than low-beta assets.
  Investors could exploit this inefficiency by using ETFs. This algorithm is going to explore this phenomenon.

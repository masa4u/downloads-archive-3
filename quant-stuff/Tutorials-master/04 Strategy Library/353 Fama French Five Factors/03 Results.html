    In this example, the portfolio is rebalanced every 30 days and the backtest period runs from Jan 2010 to Aug 2019. You can improve upon this strategy by changing the fundamental factors, the weight of each factor and the rebalance frequency.

    The Fama French five-factor model provides a scientific way to measure asset pricing. For the five aspects that Fama and French mentioned, we used one possible combination in our backtest. We can see from the results that it achieves an annual rate of return around 5% with a max drawdown of 30% over 8 years.
    These factors perhaps cannot capture a sufficient amount of information on the assets' pricing, and therefore, there are still many aspects can be improved (e.g. the weights of factors, a different set of factors for different kinds of equities,etc.) We encourage you to explore and create better algorithms upon this tutorial!

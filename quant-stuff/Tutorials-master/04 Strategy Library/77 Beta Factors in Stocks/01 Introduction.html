  Beta is a statistical measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. Stock analysts use this measure to get a sense of stocks' risk profiles.
  It is also a key component of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), A stock's price variability is essential to consider when assessing risk. It represents the co-movement instead of the volatility. Therefore, it is possible for a stock to have zero beta and higher volatility than the market.

  In the real world, some investors are prohibited from using leverage and other investorsâ€™ leverage is limited by margin requirements.
  Therefore, their only way to achieve higher returns is to buy more risky stocks, which would cause the overvaluation of higher-beta stocks.
  This behavior suggests that high-beta (risky) stocks should deliver lower risk-adjusted returns than low-beta stocks.
  In this algorithm, we'll use the leverage to explore the inefficiency of the beta factor.

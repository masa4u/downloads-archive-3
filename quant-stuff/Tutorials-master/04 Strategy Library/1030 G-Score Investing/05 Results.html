    Since we use Technology as the industry, we decided to use Nasdaq-100, or ^NDX, as the benchmark, which we track
    using the QQQ ETF. Our algorithm achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 0.778 from April 2016 to September 2020, and so it is
    outperformed by simply holding QQQ, which yielded a Sharpe Ratio of 1.22 over the same period.

    When measuring the profitability of a strategy, it is usually not enough to be profitable, as it should also beat
    the benchmark, for which the SP500 Index is most commonly used. If not, what would be the reason to not just invest
    in a low-cost SP500 index instead (not accounting for risk)? However, what if we could beat the SP500 with the SP500?
    This is what Gayed et al. proposed with their strategy of using Leveraged SP500 indices with Systematic Risk Management.
    They propose that Moving Averages are a good method to assess volatility in the market, and they use it to manage risk,
    which is especially important since the effects of price swings in a leveraged ETF are magnified due to the leverage.
    With this method, we hope to outperform the SP500 while at the same time, attempt to reduce drawdown.

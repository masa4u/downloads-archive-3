<p>
    We develop hold/liquidate positions based on the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of our ETF, for which we use SSO,
    a 2x leveraged SP500 index ETF. With 200 days instead of using fewer days, say 50, we reduce the number of trades per year,
    thereby reducing transaction costs and the effects of slippage. Moving on, if the current price of SOO is above the 200-day SMA,
    we hold SSO, and if SSO dips below our 200-day SMA, we sell liquidate our position and rotate our position into short-term
    treasuries, which is done through SHY, an ETF that tracks 1-3 year U.S. Treasury Bonds. If we are holding SHY, and the
    current price of SSO moves above the 200-day SMA, then we rotate back into SSO and liquidate SHY.

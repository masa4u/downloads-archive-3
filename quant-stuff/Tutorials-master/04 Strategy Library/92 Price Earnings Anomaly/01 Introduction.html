The Price to Earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is the ratio of a company's
market price per share to the company's earnings per share.

  \[Price \ to \ Earnings\ Ratio=\frac{Market \ price \ per \ share}{Earnings \ per \ share \ from \ the \ most \ recent \ financial \ year}\]

The P/E ratio is often used by investors to determine the valuation of a company's stock. Research suggests that a portfolio that consists of stocks with relatively low P/E 
ratio outperforms a portfolio that consists of stocks with relatively high P/E ratio.

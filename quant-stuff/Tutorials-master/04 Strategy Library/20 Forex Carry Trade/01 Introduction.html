  Carry trade is very common in the foreign exchange market.
  The strategy systematically sells low-interest rate currencies and buys high-interest rates currencies. The “carry” of an asset is the opportunity cost of holding that asset. Carry trade strategy holds one currency relative to another in order to capture the spread between the rates. We can think of this strategy as borrowing money from one country with a lower interest rate and investing it in another country with a higher interest rate.

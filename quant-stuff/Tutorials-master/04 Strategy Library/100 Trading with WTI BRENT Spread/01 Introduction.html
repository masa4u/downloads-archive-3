  The WTI-Brent spread is the difference between the prices of two types of crude oil: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) on the long side and Brent Crude (Brent) on the short side.
  For years, the price difference between the two has only been a few dollars on average. As both oils are very similar, their spread shows signs of strong predictability and usually oscillates around some average value.
  Therefore, it is possible to use deviations from the fair spread value to bet on convergence back to fair value. Here we present a trading strategy based on the price deviations of the spread.

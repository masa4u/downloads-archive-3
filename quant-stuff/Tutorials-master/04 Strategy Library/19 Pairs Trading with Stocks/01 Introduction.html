  The pairs trading algorithm aims to find two stocks which have prices that moved historically together.
  If price series diverges, long and short positions are opened in the opposite direction. With the assumption
  of mean reversion, the algorithm expects to make profits from the abnormal fluctuation of prices.
  The crucial part of pairs trading is determining which stocks are correlated and how to define a price divergence.

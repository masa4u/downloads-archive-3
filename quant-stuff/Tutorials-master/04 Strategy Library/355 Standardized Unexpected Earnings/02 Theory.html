	In market efficiency literature, one frequently discussed topic is the anomalous behavior of stock returns following earnings announcements. The market does not adjust to news from earning announcements instantaneously. Instead, many studies report evidence that the direction and magnitude of returns in the post-earnings announcement period are positively correlated with the direction and magnitude of the unexpected component in the earnings releases. This observed phenomenon is consistent with suggestions that the capital market is inefficient.

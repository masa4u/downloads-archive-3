  In this tutorial, we train a Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) to forecast the intraday price movements of the SPY ETF using a 
  collection of technical indicators. The implementation is based on the research produced by Zhou et al (2013), where a GBM 
  was found to produce an annualized Sharpe ratio greater than 20. Our research shows that throughout a 5 year backtest, the 
  model underperforms the SPY with its current parameter set. However, we finish the tutorial with highlighting potential 
  areas of further research to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

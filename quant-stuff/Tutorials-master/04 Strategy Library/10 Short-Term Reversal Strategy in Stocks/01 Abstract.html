  In this tutorial, we implement a version of the short-term reversal strategy published by De Groot, Huij, & Zhou 
  (2012). The strategy works by observing the returns of each security in the universe over the previous month. Every 
  week, the algorithm longs the worst performers and shorts the top performers. The original strategy outlined in the 
  literature considers the entire universe of stocks when trading. To reduce trading costs, we limit our universe to 
  the most liquid large cap stocks. Our analysis shows the strategy underperforms the S&P 500 index during all our 
  backtest periods except the 2020 market crash.

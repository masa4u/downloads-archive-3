  The momentum effect is a classic anomaly that says what was strongly going up in the past will probably continue to go up in the near future.  The calculation performed uses the rate of change in price movements. We see this effect in REITs through studies where REITs with the highest annual past performance beat lower performing trusts. This strategy will take a long position in companies with the strongest momentum and rebalance quarterly.

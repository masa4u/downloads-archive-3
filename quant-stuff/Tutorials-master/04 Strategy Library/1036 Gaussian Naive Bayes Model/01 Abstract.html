  Naïve Bayes models have become popular for their success in spam email filtering. In this tutorial, we train 
  Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) classifiers to forecast the daily returns of stocks in the technology sector given the 
  historical returns of the sector. Our implementation shows the strategy has a greater Sharpe and lower variance 
  than the SPY ETF over a 5 year backtest and during the 2020 stock market crash. The algorithm we build here follows 
  the research done by Lu (2016) and Imandoust & Bolandraftar (2014).

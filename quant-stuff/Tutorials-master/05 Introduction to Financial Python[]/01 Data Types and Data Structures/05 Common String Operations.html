A string is an immutable sequence of characters. It can be sliced by index just like a tuple:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">my_str = 'Welcome to QuantConnect'
print(my_str[8:])
[out]: to QuantConnect
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  There are many methods associated with strings. We can use string.count() to count the occurrences of a character in a string, use string.find() to return the index of a specific character, and use string.replace() to replace characters.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
print("Counting the number of e's in this sentence".count('e'))
[out]: 6
print('The first time e appears in this sentence'.find('e'))
[out]: 2
print('all the a in this sentence now becomes e'.replace('a','e'))
[out]: ell the e in this sentence now becomes e
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  The most commonly used method for strings is string.split(). This method will split the string by the indicated character and return a list:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">Time = '2016-04-01 09:43:00'
splited_list = Time.split(' ')
date = splited_list[0]
time = splited_list[1]
print(date, time)
[out]: 2016-04-01 09:43:00
hour = time.split(':')[0]
print(hour)
[out]: 09
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  We can replace parts of a string by our variable. This is called string formatting.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">my_time = 'Hour: {}, Minute: {}'.format(9, 43)
print(my_time)
[out]: Hour: 9, Minute: 43
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  Another way to format a string is to use the % symbol.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">print 'pi is %f' % 3.14
[out]: pi is 3.140000
print('%s to %s' % ('Welcome', 'QuantConnect'))
[out]: Welcome to QuantConnect
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  %s is a placeholder that takes in a string. Similarly %f takes a float and %d takes an integer.

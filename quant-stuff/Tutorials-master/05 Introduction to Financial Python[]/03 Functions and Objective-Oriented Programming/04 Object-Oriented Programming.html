<p>
  Python is an object-oriented programming language. It's important to understand the concept of "objects" because almost every kind of data from QuantConnect API is an object.
</p>

<h4>Class</h4>
<p>
  A class is a type of data, just like a string, float, or list. When we create an object of that data type, we call it an <strong>instance</strong> of a class.
</p>

<p>
  In Python, everything is an object - everything is an instance of some class. The data stored inside an object are called <strong>attributes</strong>, and the functions which are associated with the object are called <strong>methods</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  For example, as mentioned above, a list is an object of the "list" class, and it has a method list.sort().
</p>

<p>
  We can create our own objects by defining a class. We would do this when it's helpful to group certain functions together. For example, we define a class named "Stock" here:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">class Stock:
    def __init__(self, ticker, open, close, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.open = open
        self.close = close
        self.volume = volume
        self.rate_return = float(close)/open - 1

    def update(self, open, close):
        self.open = open
        self.close = close
        self.rate_return = float(self.close)/self.open - 1

    def print_return(self):
        print self.rate_return
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  The "Stock" class has attributes "ticker", "open", "close", "volume" and "rate_return". Inside the class body, the first method is called __init__, which is a special method. When we create a new instance of the class, the __init__ method is immediately executed with all the parameters that we pass to the "Stock" object. The purpose of this method is to set up a new "Stock" object using data we have provided.
</p>

<p>
  Here we create two Stock objects named "apple" and "google".
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">apple  = Stock('AAPL', 143.69, 144.09, 20109375)
google = Stock('GOOGL', 898.7, 911.7, 1561616)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  Stock objects also have two other methods: update() and print_return(). We can access the attribues of a Stock object and call its methods:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">apple.ticker
[out]: 'AAPL'
google.print_return()
[out]: 0.0144653388227
google.update(912.8,913.4)
google.print_return()
[out]: 0.000657318141981
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  By calling the update() function, we updated the open and close prices of a stock. Please note that when we use the attributes or call the methods <strong>inside a class</strong>, we need to specify them as self.attribute or self.method(), otherwise Python will deem them as global variables and thus raise an error.
</p>

<p>
  We can add an attribute to an object anywhere:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">
apple.ceo = 'Tim Cook'
apple.ceo
[out]: 'Tim Cook'
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  We can check what names (i.e. attributes and methods) are defined on an object using the dir() function:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">dir(apple)
[out]:
['__doc__',
 '__init__',
 '__module__',
 'ceo',
 'close',
 'open',
 'print_return',
 'rate_return',
 'ticker',
 'update',
 'volume']
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Inheritance</h4>

<p>
  Inheritance is a way of arranging classes in a hierarchy from the most general to the most specific. A "child" class is a more specific type of a "parent" class because a child class will inherit all the attribues and methods of its parent. For example, we define a class named "Child" which inherits "Stock":
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">class Child(Stock):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  Then we create an object:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">aa = Child('AA')
print aa.name
[out]: 'AA'
aa.update(100, 102)
print aa.open
[out]: 100
print aa.close
[out]: 102
print aa.print_return()
[out]: 0.02</pre>
</div>
As seen above, the new class Child has inherited the methods from Stock.

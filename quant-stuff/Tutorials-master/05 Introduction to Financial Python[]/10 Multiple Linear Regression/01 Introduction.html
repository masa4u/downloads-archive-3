  In the last chapter we introduced simple linear regression, which has only one independent variable. In this chapter we will learn about linear regression with multiple independent variables.

<p>
  A simple linear regression model is written in the following form:
</p>
\[ Y = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon \]

<p>
  A <strong>multiple linear regression</strong> model with <em>p</em> variables is given by:
</p>
\[ Y = \alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon \]

<p>
  Loops are an essential part of programming. The "for" and "while" loops run a block of code repeatedly.
</p>

<h4>While Loop</h4>

<p>
  A "while" loop will run repeatedly until a certain condition has been met.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">i = 0
while i &lt; 5:
    print i
    i += 1
[out]:
0
1
2
3
4
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  When making a while loop, we need to ensure that something changes from iteration to iteration so that the while loop will terminate, otherwise, it will run forever. Here we used i += 1 (short for i = i + 1) to make i larger after each iteration. This is the most commonly used method to control a while loop.
</p>

<h4>For Loop</h4>

<p>
  A "for" loop will iterate over a sequence of value and terminate when the sequence has ended.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">for x in [1,2,3,4,5]: print x
[out]:
1
2
3
4
5
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  We can also add if statements in a for loop. Here is a real example from our pairs trading algorithm:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">stocks = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB','F','V', 'G', 'GE']
selected = ['AAPL','IBM']
new_list = []
for stock in stocks:
    if stock not in selected:
        new_list.append(stock)
print new_list
[out]: ['GOOG', 'FB', 'F', 'V', 'G', 'GE']
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  Here we iterated all the elements in the list 'stocks'. Later in this chapter, we will introduce a smarter way to do this, which is just a one-line code.
</p>

<h4>Break and continue</h4>

<p>
  These are two commonly used commands in a for loop. If "break" is triggered while a loop is executing, the loop will terminate immediately:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">stocks = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB','F','V', 'G', 'GE']
for stock in stocks:
    print stock
    if stock == 'FB': break
[out]:
AAPL
GOOG
IBM
FB
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  The "continue" command tells the loop to end this iteration and skip to the next iteration:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">stocks = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB','F','V', 'G', 'GE']
for stock in stocks:
    if stock == 'FB': continue
    print stock
[out]:
AAPL
GOOG
IBM
F
V
G
GE
</pre>
</div>

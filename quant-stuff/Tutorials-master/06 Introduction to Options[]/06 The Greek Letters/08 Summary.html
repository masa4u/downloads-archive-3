  In this chapter we discussed various Greeks, their meanings and their implications on the pricing and hedging of derivatives. We also presented some useful formulas for calculating the Greeks value of European options and generated the plots to show how they changed with strikes and time to expirations. The Greeks letter is the sensitivity measure of options price to the market variables. Next chapter we will discuss another major risk measures: volatility.

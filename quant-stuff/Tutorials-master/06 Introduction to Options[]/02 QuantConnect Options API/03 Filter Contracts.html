  After adding the options for specific underlying stock,  you can set the filter criteria with <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic27633.html">SetFilter</a> method to pull contracts using the specified min and max strike and expiration range values you need for a given symbol.

  Here parameters <em>min Strike</em> and <em>max Strike</em> are the relative multipliers with respect to the market price. We use Google(NASDAQ: GOOG)<span lang="EN-GB"> as an example to describe the filter criteria. If today is 01/03/2017, the market price of underlying stock is $776, the strike prices of GOOG options are spaced $2.5. Then <code>SetFilter(-1, +2, timedelta(0), timedelta(90))</code> will fist look up at the money contracts with strike being K=$777.5 (Here K is 777.5 the next closest multiple to the underlying price of 775 since rarely will an option be ATM exactly). Then SetFilter will look for options with strikes between and including ( 777.5 - 2.5*1, 777.5 + 2.5*2). The time to expiration of these options are restricted within 90 days from now on. </span>

  For the strike, the exchange normally chooses the strike prices at which options can be written so that they are spaced $2.50, $5, or $10 apart. Typically the spacing is $2.50 when the stock price is between $5 and $25, $5 when the stock price is between $25 and $200, and $10 for stock prices above $200. So you should carefully choose the parameters of <em>min strike</em> and <em>max Strike</em> in case there are no contracts that satisfy the filter criteria if the range is too small, less than the minimum units of strike prices change.

  For the expiry, there are many expiration dates that apply to the different series of options. An option cycle is the pattern of months in which options contracts expire. There are three kinds of common option cycles. The options on the January cycle have contracts available in the first month of each quarter (January, April, July and October). Options assigned to the February cycle use the middle month of each quarter (February, May, August and November). And options in the March cycle have options available during the last month of each quarter (March, June, September and December). In addition, individual stock options typically expire in the current month and the subsequent month.

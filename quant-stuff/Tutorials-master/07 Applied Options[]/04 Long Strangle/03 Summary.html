	In this algorithm, at time 0, we buy OTM call with strike price 870 and OTM put with strike price 795. The share price of GOOG at time 0 is $832.8. At the expiry, the share price of GOOG is $930.16, and so the call option is exercised and we get 100 shares of GOOG while the put option expires worthless.

	You can enter into a Long Strangle if you have no clear idea of market direction but forecast that there will be a great movement in the underlying asset. As the options you buy are all out of the money, the premium cost of entering this position is low. However,Â because the call and the put options are all out of the money, the stock will need to move even more significantly than in a long straddle in order to profit from this strategy.

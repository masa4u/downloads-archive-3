Carefully planning and structuring your lesson is critical to ensuring its success. In the next section, we'll create this plan step by step. Boot Camp lessons typically fall into one of the following algorithm types: <em>Macro Economics, Technical Indicators, Scaling, Market Making, Market Microstructure, Sentimental, or Value-Fundamental Investing.</em>
</p>

<h4>1. Strategy Selection</h4>
<p>
Every BootCamp lesson is focused on an algorithmic strategy's implementation. The first step to planning a lesson is choosing a strategy which does not overlap with any of the existing BootCamp topics. This can be incrementally more difficult but should introduce new concepts.
</p>

<h4>2. Strategy Implementation</h4>
<p>
After selecting your strategy you need to fully implement the algorithm, writing the code in C# and Python as simply as possible. Users new to coding have a hard time deciphering large blocks of code so strategies should be kept very simple.
</p>

<p>In writing the strategy remain aware of the conceptual layers you put into the algorithm's codebase. These layers of concepts are where you can separate out the lesson tasks. For example: in writing a lesson <i>"Buy and Hold, with Trailing Stop"</i> you might start by coding up the buy and hold logic, followed by placing a "trailing stop" (Stop Market Order), then finally you can make the stop move by updating its trigger price. These conceptual layers form the basis for how tasks are grouped together.</p>

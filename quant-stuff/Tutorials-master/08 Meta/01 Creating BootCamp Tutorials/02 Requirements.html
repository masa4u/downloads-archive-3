Ensuring high-quality writing in BootCamp lessons is important to maintain the interest and motivation of the community. The skills required to build a BootCamp lesson cover several areas of expertise:
</p>
<ol>
<li>QuantConnect API: Contributors must have knowledge of the QuantConnect API along with the correct way to implement the desired behavior.</li>
<li>Programming Polygot: BootCamp algorithms are provided in both C# and Python. The text documentation is written in HTML, and the task validation code is performed in JavaScript. You should be able to code neatly in all four languages.</li>
<li>Principles of Algorithmic Trading: Domain expertise in finance is important to be able to build thoughtful and educational content.</li>
</ol> 
<p>
The combination of all these talents is fairly rare so we're reaching out to the community to help us create this content. If you can cover all three of these categories let us know and we'll enable BootCamp editing permissions on your account. In exchange for a completed BootCamp lesson we're offering compensation which we'll cover in the section below.
